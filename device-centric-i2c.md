# Device-Centric I2C Addressing: A Security-First Approach

## Introduction

In embedded systems, I2C communication traditionally follows a bus-centric model where any code can communicate with any device address on the bus. While this approach offers flexibility, it creates significant security and safety vulnerabilities in modern embedded systems. This document explores an alternative approach: device-centric addressing, which binds I2C communication to specific device instances at creation time.

## The Traditional Bus-Centric Model

### How It Works

In the conventional approach exemplified by embedded-HAL, I2C operations specify the target device address as a parameter:

```rust
// Bus-centric approach - address specified per operation
i2c.read(0x48, &mut temperature_data)?;
i2c.write(0x50, &configuration_data)?;
i2c.write_read(0x1D, &[0x0F], &mut accel_data)?;
```

This model treats the I2C controller as a shared bus where:
- Any code with access to the I2C peripheral can communicate with any device
- Device addresses are specified dynamically at operation time
- Multiple devices are accessed through the same interface instance
- Address validation happens at runtime, if at all

### Apparent Benefits

The bus-centric model offers several conveniences:
- **Flexibility**: Easy to scan for devices or implement address-agnostic protocols
- **Code Reuse**: Generic drivers can work with devices at any address
- **Simplicity**: One interface handles all devices on the bus
- **Familiarity**: Mirrors traditional microcontroller programming patterns

## The Device-Centric Alternative

### Core Philosophy

Device-centric addressing fundamentally changes the mental model from "I have a bus I can use to talk to devices" to "I have specific devices I own and can communicate with." Each I2C device is represented by a distinct software object bound to a specific hardware address at creation time.

```rust
// Device-centric approach - address bound at creation
let temperature_sensor = I2cDevice::new(task_id, I2C1, PORT_A, None, 0x48);
let eeprom = I2cDevice::new(task_id, I2C1, PORT_B, None, 0x50);
let accelerometer = I2cDevice::new(task_id, I2C2, PORT_A, Some((MUX_1, SEG_2)), 0x1D);

// Operations are inherently bound to specific devices
temperature_sensor.read_into(&mut data)?;
eeprom.write(&config_data)?;
accelerometer.read_reg_into(0x0F, &mut accel_data)?;
```

### Key Principles

**Device Ownership**: Each device instance represents exclusive access to a specific I2C device address. The binding between software object and hardware address is immutable after creation.

**Explicit Resource Declaration**: Device instances must be explicitly created with full addressing information, including multiplexer segments where applicable. This makes the system topology visible in code.

**Capability-Based Access**: Access to I2C devices becomes a capability that can be granted, revoked, or delegated by the system. Tasks only receive device instances for hardware they're authorized to use.

**Static Address Binding**: Device addresses cannot be changed after object creation, preventing accidental or malicious address confusion.

## Security Advantages

### Isolation and Least Privilege

Device-centric addressing enables fine-grained access control:

```rust
// Security task gets access only to crypto chip
let crypto_device = I2cDevice::new(security_task, I2C1, PORT_SECURE, None, 0x60);

// Sensor task gets access only to environmental sensors  
let temp_sensor = I2cDevice::new(sensor_task, I2C2, PORT_SENSORS, None, 0x48);
let humidity_sensor = I2cDevice::new(sensor_task, I2C2, PORT_SENSORS, None, 0x40);
```

Each task receives only the device instances it requires, implementing the principle of least privilege. A compromised sensor task cannot access cryptographic hardware, and a security task cannot interfere with sensor readings.

### Prevention of Address Confusion Attacks

In bus-centric systems, bugs or attacks can redirect communication to unintended devices:

```rust
// Bus-centric vulnerability
let user_address = get_user_input(); // Could be manipulated
i2c.write(user_address, &sensitive_data)?; // Oops!
```

Device-centric addressing eliminates this attack vector:

```rust
// Device-centric safety
let authorized_device = I2cDevice::new(task_id, I2C1, PORT_A, None, KNOWN_SAFE_ADDRESS);
authorized_device.write(&sensitive_data)?; // Cannot be misdirected
```

### Audit and Accountability

Device-centric systems provide clear audit trails:
- Which task accessed which specific device
- When device instances were created and by whom  
- What operations were performed on each device
- Complete topology mapping of system I2C resources

### Resource Exhaustion Protection

Device instances can implement per-device rate limiting and resource quotas:

```rust
impl I2cDevice {
    pub fn write(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Error> {
        self.rate_limiter.check_and_consume()?;
        self.bandwidth_tracker.record_usage(data.len())?;
        // ... perform actual I2C operation
    }
}
```

## Safety Advantages

### Compile-Time Device Validation

Device-centric addressing catches configuration errors at compile time:

```rust
// These create distinct types that cannot be confused
let temp_sensor: TemperatureSensor = TemperatureSensor::new(temp_device);
let pressure_sensor: PressureSensor = PressureSensor::new(pressure_device);

// This would be a compile error:
// let wrong_sensor: PressureSensor = PressureSensor::new(temp_device);
```

### Prevention of Cross-Device Contamination

In bus-centric systems, device state can leak between operations:

```rust
// Dangerous: leftover state from previous operation
i2c.write_read(0x48, &[0x01], &mut temp_buffer)?;
i2c.read(0x50, &mut eeprom_buffer)?; // Might get temp data if address is wrong!
```

Device-centric addressing isolates device state:

```rust
// Safe: each device maintains independent state
temp_sensor.read_register(0x01, &mut temp_buffer)?;
eeprom.read_into(&mut eeprom_buffer)?; // Guaranteed independent
```

### Clear Error Attribution

When failures occur, device-centric systems provide precise error context:

```rust
// Clear: error is definitely from the accelerometer on I2C2, MUX segment 3
accelerometer.read_reg(0x0F, &mut buffer)
    .map_err(|e| AccelerometerError::I2cFailure(e))?;
```

## Implementation in Hubris

Hubris implements device-centric addressing through its microkernel architecture:

### Task Isolation

Each Hubris task runs in its own memory protection domain. I2C device instances can only be created with explicit permission from the system, and each device instance is bound to the creating task.

### Multiplexer Awareness

Hubris explicitly models complex I2C topologies with multiplexers:

```rust
let sensor = I2cDevice::new(
    task_id,
    Controller::I2C2,
    PortIndex::Port0, 
    Some((Mux::Mux1, Segment::Segment3)), // Explicit mux routing
    0x1D
);
```

This makes the complete signal path visible and prevents accidental cross-talk between multiplexer segments.

### IPC-Based Access Control

Device access is mediated through inter-process communication with the I2C server task. The server validates that each task can only access its authorized devices and enforces resource limits.

## Comparison with embedded-HAL

| Aspect | embedded-HAL (Bus-Centric) | Hubris (Device-Centric) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Address Specification** | Per-operation parameter | At device creation time |
| **Access Control** | Runtime checking (if any) | Compile-time + IPC enforcement |
| **Resource Model** | Shared bus abstraction | Owned device instances |
| **Security Focus** | Convenience and portability | Isolation and least privilege |
| **Error Context** | Operation + address | Device identity + operation |
| **Multi-Device Access** | Single interface instance | Multiple device instances |
| **Topology Modeling** | Implicit/external | Explicit multiplexer support |
| **Target Environment** | General embedded systems | Security-critical microkernels |

## Trade-offs and Limitations

### Reduced Flexibility

Device-centric addressing sacrifices some flexibility:
- Cannot easily scan for unknown devices
- Requires advance knowledge of system topology  
- More verbose setup for simple scenarios
- Harder to write completely generic drivers

### Increased Complexity

The approach requires more sophisticated infrastructure:
- Capability management systems
- IPC mechanisms for device access
- More complex driver initialization
- Additional abstraction layers

### Performance Considerations

Device-centric systems may have different performance characteristics:
- Potential IPC overhead for each operation
- Better optimization opportunities (knowing target addresses)
- Reduced runtime address validation
- More efficient resource allocation

## When to Choose Device-Centric Addressing

Device-centric addressing is most valuable in:

**Security-Critical Systems**: Where device access must be tightly controlled and audited.

**Safety-Critical Applications**: Where cross-device interference could cause failures.

**Complex Topologies**: Systems with multiple I2C buses and multiplexers where topology clarity is essential.

**Multi-Tenant Environments**: Where different software components must be isolated from each other.

**Resource-Constrained Systems**: Where fine-grained resource management is required.

## Conclusion

Device-centric I2C addressing represents a paradigm shift from convenience-focused to security-focused embedded system design. While it introduces additional complexity and reduces some flexibility, it provides significant advantages in isolation, security, and system clarity.

The choice between bus-centric and device-centric approaches should be driven by system requirements. For simple, single-tenant embedded applications, the traditional bus-centric model may suffice. For security-critical, multi-component systems, device-centric addressing provides essential safety and security properties that outweigh its additional complexity.

As embedded systems become more connected and security-sensitive, device-centric approaches like those implemented in Hubris represent an important evolution in embedded system architecture philosophy.
